# JuliaCon 2022 talk: Optimize your marketing spend with Julia!

This is a supporting repository for a lightning talk to be given at JuliaCon 2022

Optimizing marketing spend is still difficult, but this [talk I gave at JuliaCon2022](https://youtu.be/nzR5duccxTg) introduces a modern marketing analysis, Media Mix Modelling (MMM), that can help with this difficult task.

We can combine the strength of Julia with Bayesian decision-making to optimize marketing spend for a hypothetical business.

Go to folder MediaMixModellingDemo to find the examples and presentation or refer to [[![Latest Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-blue.svg)](https://svilupp.github.io/JuliaCon2022/dev/) for detailed overview of methodology, practical tips and a lot of resources (and links to other tutorials).
