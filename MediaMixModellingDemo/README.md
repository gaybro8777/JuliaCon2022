# MediaMixModellingDemo

This repository shows an example of a key marketing analysis, Media Mix Modelling (MMM).

Presentation given at JuliaCon can be found in folder presentation (`notebook.jl`, use Pluto.jl to re-play).

This implementation combines the strength of Julia (Turing.jl and Metaheuristics.jl) with Bayesian decision-making to establish the optimal marketing spend for our hypothetical business.
Following the talk, you should be able to use the provided scripts and notebook to replicate this analysis for your business.

The general implementation closely follows the methodology of the amazing Robyn package (expect for the Bayesian Inference of the parameters). 
Please refer to the Robyn documentation for more information: [Robyn Docs](https://facebookexperimental.github.io/Robyn/docs/quick-start/)
